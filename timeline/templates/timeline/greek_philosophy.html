    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Ancient Greek philosophy is believed to have started around 600 BCE with Thales of Miletus, who is regarded as an original thinker that developed a novel way of inquiry based on Babylonian and Egyptian sources. This period marked a significant transition from mythological explanations of the world to a focus on rational thought.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">Phases of Greek Philosophy</h2>
    <br>
    
    <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">1. Presocratic Philosophy (c. 600 - 400 BCE)</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Presocratic philosophers laid the groundwork for Western thought by shifting from mythological explanations to rational inquiry. They sought naturalistic explanations for the cosmos and human existence, paving the way for subsequent philosophical thought.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Thales of Miletus </strong>(c. 585 BCE)</li>
        <li><strong>Anaximander</strong> (c. 546 BCE)</li>
        <li><strong>Pythagoras</strong> (c. 571 - 497 BCE)</li>
        <li><strong>Xenophanes of Colophon</strong>c. 570 - 478 BCE)</li>
        <li><strong>Heraclitus</strong> (c. 500 BCE)</li>
        <li><strong>Parmenides of Elea</strong>(c. 485 BCE)</li>

        <li><strong>Anaxagoras</strong>(c. 500 - 428 BCE)</li>
        <li><strong>Democritus</strong>(c. 460 - 370 BCE)</li>
        <li><strong>Gorgias</strong>(c. 427 BCE)</li>   </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Key Figures and Teachings</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Thales:</strong> Proposed that water is the fundamental principle of all things.</li>
        <li><strong>Anaximander:</strong> Introduced the concept of the *apeiron* (the boundless) as the source of all things.</li>

        <li><strong>Xenophanes:</strong> Criticized anthropomorphic depictions of gods.</li>
        <li><strong>Heraclitus:</strong> Emphasized change with the idea that "everything flows."</li>

    <br>

    <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">2. Classical Philosophy (c. 400 - 300 BCE)</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This phase focuses on ethical and political philosophy, marked by the contributions of three foundational figures: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Their teachings explored the nature of virtue, justice, and the ideal society.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Socrates:</strong> <br>Developed the Socratic method, a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue that encourages critical thinking and self-reflection, emphasizing ethics and self-examination.</li>
        <li><strong>Plato:</strong> <br>Founded the Academy, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world, and introduced the Theory of Forms, positing a realm of perfect ideas that transcend the material world.</li>
        <li><strong>Aristotle:</strong> <br>A student of Plato, he focused on empirical observation and categorization across various fields, including ethics, politics, metaphysics, and biology, developing a comprehensive system of Western philosophy.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">3. Hellenistic Philosophy (c. 300 - 100 BCE)</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This phase saw philosophy become more practical, focusing on how to live a good life amid changing circumstances. Key schools of thought emerged during this period, each offering unique perspectives on ethics and happiness.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Epicureanism:</strong><br>Founded by Epicurus, it taught that pleasure is the highest good, emphasizing simple living and the pursuit of intellectual and emotional fulfillment over material wealth.</li>
        <li><strong>Stoicism:</strong><br> Founded by Zeno of Citium, it emphasized virtue as the highest good, advocating for self-control, rationality, and living in accordance with nature, while accepting circumstances beyond one's control.</li>
        <li><strong>Skepticism:</strong><br> Advocated by Pyrrho, it questioned the possibility of certain knowledge, promoting a philosophy of suspended judgment to achieve tranquility in life.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">4. Roman Influence and Post-Hellenistic Thought (c. 100 BCE - 200 CE)</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This phase integrated Greek philosophy into Roman culture, leading to new interpretations and adaptations that influenced early Christian thought and shaped the future of Western philosophy.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Cynicism:</strong><br> Advocated by Diogenes of Sinope, it promoted a life in accordance with nature, rejecting societal conventions and material possessions in favor of self-sufficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Neoplatonism:</strong><br> Founded by Plotinus, it synthesized Platonic thought with religious elements, emphasizing a single source from which all existence emanates and advocating for a return to this source through philosophical contemplation.</li>
        <li><strong>Theology and Philosophy:</strong><br> Philosophers like Gregory Palamas integrated philosophical inquiry with Christian theology, exploring metaphysics, ethics, and the relationship between faith and reason.</li>
    </ul>
